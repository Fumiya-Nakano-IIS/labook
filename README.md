### üìñ Book Status

- To get current status (on shelf/on loan), use `/books` or `/books/<isbn>` and include status in the response, using the SQL below.

---

## üîç How to Determine Current Book Status

- A book is **"on shelf"** if there is no loan record with `return_date IS NULL`.
- A book is **"on loan"** if there exists a `Loans` record for that ISBN with `return_date IS NULL`.

Example SQL:

```sql
-- Check current loan status
SELECT
  B.isbn,
  B.title,
  S.shelf_name,
  U.name AS current_holder,
  CASE
    WHEN L.return_date IS NULL THEN 'On Loan'
    ELSE 'On Shelf'
  END AS status
FROM Books B
LEFT JOIN Shelves S ON B.shelf_code = S.shelf_code
LEFT JOIN Loans L ON B.isbn = L.isbn AND L.return_date IS NULL
LEFT JOIN Users U ON L.user_id = U.user_id;
```

## üìå Notes

- Each book has one owner (owner_id), which is a lab member (Users table).
- Comments allow optional remarks (e.g., damage, language, edition).
- Lending records are not restricted by copy (still one record per ISBN).
- Cover images are managed via path (e.g. /covers/9781234567890.jpg).
